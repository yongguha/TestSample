# Android Room Persistence Library Sample

This project exemplifies possible use cases of Android Room from the Android Architecture Components libraries with sample implementations in both Java and Kotlin both with two sub-flavors with and without utilizing Dagger dependency injection framework.

Kotlin and Java have one Basic and Dagger flavor each, whereas common sources are used in both flavor types. Resources are in the main source set, since all versions are essentially the exact same app to demonstrate the differences in implementation.
